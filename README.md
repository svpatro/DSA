### Installation

### Execution

Depending on your platform, rendering the animation can be done in a few different ways.

Windows: `manimce -qh [filename].py`

Linux/MacOS: `python3 -m manim -qh [filename].py`

Both of these will produce animations in a directory entitled `media` adjacent to the `[filename].py`
