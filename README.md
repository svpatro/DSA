# Installation

Install [Manim Community Edition](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html#local-installation) on your respective platform.

# Execution

Depending on your platform, rendering the animation can be done in a few different ways.

Windows: `manimce -qh [filename].py`

Linux/MacOS: `python3 -m manim -qh [filename].py`

Both of these will produce animations in a directory entitled `media` adjacent to the `[filename].py`

To ensure that all dependencies were installed correctly, run `test.py` on your respective platform.
